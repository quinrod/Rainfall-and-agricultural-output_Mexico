Weather extrapolation and OLS

## Findings
- In 2010 Mexico suffered one of the most severe droughts on record. 
- However, those who complete the training stay in the job 3.36 months less, on average, than those who do not. 
- At firm level, results show that having a course approved is associated with higher turnover in the short run when considering subgroups of workers who participate in Pronatec-MDIC. The effect dissipates in the third year.

## Suggestions
- The fact that only one Ministry employs this demand - driven design out of 21 eligible Ministries provides  an  opportunity  to  switch  to  a  demand - driven  training  model  to improve  labor productivity in the long run 16 , a phenomenon that may be holding back the labor productivity potential of firms in the country. 
- Ultimately , this supply - driven programs spent BRL 2.4 billion annually in  2015 17 while  demand - driven  programs  can  be  more cost-effective,  specially  in times of fiscal consolidation.

## Data
Clean and merge datasets from weather stations and agricultural activity to weather insurance payouts and subsidies:

`Weather station info`: Daily temperature and rainfall daily between 2000 and 2013 from several georeferenced weather stations.

`Agricultural activity`: Hectares of agricultural cultivation and production by municipality and crop on a monthly basis between 2002 and 2013.

`Weather insurance payouts`: Payout disbursed to farmers by state and federal governments by municipality and crop between 2003 and 2014.

`Agricultural subsidies`: Direct support from the state to farmers between 2000 and 2014.
